# Refactoring the Code

---

## Overview of Project

For this challenge we looked at code written to examine a certain amount of stocks, and refactored to it to be able to examine several thousands of stocks

## Results, Analysis, and Challenges

### Results of the Re-factoring and Analysis
- The re-factoring was a success, the code was not only streamlined, but it now works for a larger grouping of data than before. So lets take a look at the charts and what they show. Lets start with the obvious, 2017 was a great year for portfolios, and 2018 was a bit of a fall (in my personal opinion, 2018 would be the time to buy)(also see pictures 1a and 1b). 
- Now lets examine the code and the changes that I made to it to accommodate the request from the client. Instead of 
just going through the various tickers and having it go through several loops, I created a single (but a bit more complex) loop and had the data stored into various output arrays. Then the code was taken and output to the correct column in order to be displayed (see picture 1c).
